## Description

This is a package that can help you send logs through monolog to slack using webhooks.
Monolog already has a Slack handler but I am not in favor for these reasons:

**It has some bugs**

- It does not normalize correctly objects [see](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/pull/1127)
- Slack accepts until 2000 chars for [see](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/issues/909)

**Performance**

- Although Monolog has the `WhatFailureGroupHandler` I would consider it simpler not to wrap my handler around another
 handler and have a simpler and faster logic [see](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/issues/920)
- SlackWebhookHandler does not have timeouts and it executes retries if Slack service is down [see](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/pull/846#issuecomment-373522968)

**Formatting**

- Current package gives you the ability to add a custom formatter to the handler in order to format Attachments.
Although you can pass a formatter to Slack Handlers of monolog the formatter is applied only to simple messages of slack
and they are not executed for Attachments.
- I like the formatting that I created better than the one that monolog has.
